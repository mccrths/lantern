# Scholarship and Creative Works (Faculty)

The Scholarship and Creative Works collections are managed by the Scholarly Communications Librarian and the Library Assistant.

## Types and Formats

The predominant content type is "Article". Other common formats include:

- Preprint or postprint
- Conference proceeding
- Book chapter or section

## Procedures

### Submissions

Faculty or their representative submit their manuscripts through a LibWizard form, including metadata for the publication, and affirmation that they have permission to share the attached copy of the publication under applicable copyright laws. If the faculty member does not have permission, or is not sure, they are instructed to reach out to the Scholarly Communications Librarian.

### Ingest

The Scholarly Communications Librarian or Library Technician will process completed submissions on an ongoing basis, or at minimum once per business week.

### Problems

In cases where copyright is not cleared, or submissions are otherwise incomplete, a member of the team will reach out to the submitter for clarification.
