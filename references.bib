Abstract = {This paper describes an investigation into whether institutional repositories at member libraries of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) provide publicly available metadata documentation via the repositories' websites. The study compares the results of a September 2017 survey with findings from a review of ARL institutional repository websites. Slightly more than half of ARL institutional repositories do provide metadata documentation. Implications of the results are discussed, including specific research questions for moving forward. A call to reimagine documentation as a tool of transparency is delivered.},

Abstract = {Academic libraries offer educational outreach surrounding their technology services available to users. When using those same technology services for internal projects, librarians can better understand the mechanisms behind these technologies, allowing for meaningful outreach efforts in which librarians serve as both primary users and facilitators of use. This paper highlights a case study of leveraging an institutional license to Overleaf, a collaborative LaTeX editor, to rebuild documentation on the use of KiltHub, an institutional repository. This requires a complex mix of text, images, tables, and even videos, and presented a tremendous challenge to format in Microsoft Word and Google Docs. In leveraging the library's own technologies, the KiltHub team gained a greater understanding of how to use and teach with these platforms, ultimately better serving campus users.

Abstract = {With resource sharing staff staying an average of 3-5 years, capturing policies and procedures to facilitate onboarding and strengthen institutional memory is key in building consistent workflows. Creating documentation was a multi-stage process executed over several years. Initially, the staff supervisor wrote office policies and assigned staff to write step-by-step guides for common workflows. These were kept in shared storage and evaluated and updated periodically. During pandemic closures, mind-mapping in MindManager aided gap analysis to prioritize areas of the workflow not yet documented. Most recently, this documentation moved into Microsoft Teams which both limits inadvertent alteration and facilitates searchability.},
